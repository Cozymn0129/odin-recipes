    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish originating from Italy, typically consisting of a flat,
        round base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of other ingredients such as meats,
        vegetables, and herbs.
        Its appeal lies in the balance of textures and flavours: the crisp or chewy crust, the savoury richness of
        melted cheese,
        and the freshness or spice of chosen toppings.
        While the classic Neapolitan pizza is characterised by a thin, blistered crust and simple toppings like
        mozzarella, basil, and tomato,
        countless variations exist, from deep-dish pies in Chicago to thin, foldable slices in New York.
        <br>
        Over time, pizza has become a truly global food, adapting to local tastes and ingredients wherever it goes.
        In Japan, for instance, you might find toppings like squid or mayonnaise,
        while in India, spicy curries often make their way onto the crust.
        Gourmet pizzerias experiment with artisanal cheeses, truffle oil, or even dessert-style toppings, proving
        pizza’s versatility.
        Whether eaten as a quick takeaway meal or savoured in a wood-fired oven at a restaurant, pizza remains one of
        the world’s most universally loved and customisable dishes.
