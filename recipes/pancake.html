    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A pancake is a simple yet universally loved dish made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and a leavening agent
        such as baking powder, cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan. Its charm lies in its versatility—thin and
        delicate like crêpes in France, thick and fluffy in the American style, or somewhere in between depending on
        culture and recipe. The surface usually turns golden brown while the inside stays soft and tender, making it the
        perfect base for sweet or savoury toppings.
        <br>
        Across the world, pancakes take on many delicious identities. In the UK, they are traditionally thin and often
        enjoyed with a squeeze of lemon and sugar on Shrove Tuesday. In Japan, “hotcakes” are extra thick and airy,
        sometimes stacked high and served almost like a dessert. Meanwhile, in the United States and Canada, pancakes
        are a breakfast classic, often drenched in butter and maple syrup. From potato latkes to Korean pajeon,
        countless variations exist, but they all share the same comforting essence: simple ingredients transformed into
        something warm, satisfying, and endlessly adaptable.
