    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that centres on vinegared rice, often paired with seafood, vegetables, or
        egg.
        While many people associate sushi with raw fish, the key ingredient is actually the rice, seasoned with a subtle
        mix of vinegar, sugar, and salt.
        The dish takes many forms—nigiri (a slice of fish pressed over a small bed of rice), maki (rolls wrapped in
        seaweed),
        and chirashi (scattered toppings over a bowl of rice), to name a few.
        Sushi highlights balance and simplicity, showcasing the natural flavours of fresh ingredients rather than
        masking them with heavy seasoning.
        <br>
        Over the years, sushi has grown from a Japanese delicacy into a global culinary phenomenon.
        Outside Japan, sushi has been adapted to local palates with creations like the California roll,
        which often substitutes avocado and imitation crab for more traditional ingredients.
        High-end sushi restaurants may serve omakase, a chef’s choice tasting menu, where the emphasis is on seasonality
        and artistry.
        Whether enjoyed as an affordable lunch at a conveyor-belt restaurant or as a carefully crafted fine-dining
        experience,
        sushi represents both Japan’s culinary heritage and the world’s fascination with fresh, elegant food.
