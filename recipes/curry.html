    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Curry is a broad term for a variety of dishes, most often associated with South Asian cuisine,
        though it has spread across the world and taken on many regional forms.
        At its core, curry usually refers to a spiced sauce or gravy that can be paired with meat, fish, or vegetables,
        and eaten with rice or bread. The spices used are often a blend, featuring ingredients like turmeric, cumin,
        coriander, ginger, and chilli,
        which together create a complex flavour profile ranging from earthy and warming to hot and fiery.
        In India, curries are incredibly diverse—each region, and often each household, has its own recipes and spice
        mixes,
        making “curry” less of a single dish and more of a cooking tradition.
        <br>
        Outside South Asia, curry has evolved into countless adaptations shaped by local tastes and available
        ingredients.
        In Japan, for example, curry is typically a thick, mildly spiced stew served with rice, while in Thailand,
        curries are made with coconut milk and fresh herbs, resulting in fragrant and often spicy dishes like green or
        red curry.
        In the UK, curry has become a cornerstone of the national food scene, with dishes such as chicken tikka masala
        being embraced as classics.
        This global journey shows how curry has transformed from regional cooking to a worldwide comfort food,
        constantly reinvented yet always tied to its roots in spice and warmth.
