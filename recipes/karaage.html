    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Karaage is a beloved Japanese dish consisting of bite-sized pieces of chicken that are marinated, coated in
        starch, and deep-fried to golden perfection. Unlike Western fried chicken, karaage often uses potato starch (or
        a mix with flour), which creates a thinner, crispier coating that clings tightly to the juicy meat inside. The
        marinade—usually a mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin, ginger, and garlic—infuses the chicken with savoury, slightly
        sweet, and aromatic flavours before it even hits the oil. The result is chicken that’s crispy on the outside,
        succulent on the inside, and packed with umami.
        <br>
        Karaage is incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in many ways. It’s often served simply with a wedge of lemon
        to brighten the flavour, or paired with shredded cabbage, rice, or miso soup as part of a set meal. In izakaya
        (Japanese pubs), karaage is a popular snack to accompany beer, while in bento boxes it’s a go-to protein because
        it stays tasty even when cold. Beyond chicken, the karaage technique can be applied to fish, squid, or even
        tofu, making it more of a style of cooking than just a single dish. Its balance of crispiness, juiciness, and
        savoury depth has earned it a place as one of Japan’s most iconic comfort foods.
