    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat sheets of pasta with rich fillings such as ragù (a
        slow-cooked meat and tomato sauce), béchamel, and cheese, most famously mozzarella or Parmigiano-Reggiano. Baked
        until bubbling and golden, it combines soft pasta, creamy sauce, and savoury depth in every bite. Its structure
        makes it both hearty and comforting, often served as a centrepiece at family gatherings or festive occasions.
        While traditional recipes emphasise simplicity and balance, lasagna’s layered format leaves endless room for
        variation.
        <br>
        Outside Italy, lasagna has been reinterpreted in many creative ways. Vegetarian versions swap the meat for
        spinach, mushrooms, or roasted vegetables, while some modern adaptations use seafood, pesto, or even replace the
        pasta with alternatives like aubergine slices or zucchini. In the United States, lasagna has become a beloved
        household staple, often loaded with extra cheese and baked in large pans for sharing. This adaptability, paired
        with its indulgent, satisfying character, has helped lasagna cement its place as one of the world’s favourite
        comfort foods.
