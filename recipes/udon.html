    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Udon is a type of thick, chewy Japanese noodle made from wheat flour, water, and salt, often served in a hot
        broth or chilled with dipping sauce. Its simplicity allows it to take on a wide variety of flavours, from the
        gentle savouriness of a clear dashi broth topped with scallions, to richer variations like curry udon, where the
        noodles are bathed in a spiced sauce. The texture of udon is central to its appeal—soft yet pleasantly firm,
        making it hearty and satisfying. Classic toppings include tempura, thinly sliced beef, or a raw egg, but the
        noodles themselves are versatile enough to stand as the star of the dish.
        <br>
        Across Japan, regional styles of udon reflect local tastes and traditions. In Kagawa Prefecture, known as the
        “Udon Prefecture,” sanuki udon is especially famous for its firm, springy bite, while in Kansai, the broth tends
        to be lighter and more delicate. Beyond Japan, udon has also gained popularity internationally, often appearing
        in Japanese restaurants alongside ramen and soba. Whether enjoyed as a comforting bowl on a cold day or a
        chilled dish in summer, udon is cherished for its adaptability and its role as a staple of Japanese comfort
        food.
